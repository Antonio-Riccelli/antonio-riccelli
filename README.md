### Some bio, why not?

I'm originally from Naples, Italy.

It looked like I was getting into computers and tech from an early age, inspired by people like [John Romero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Romero), [John Carmack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack), [Richard Garriott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Garriott), [Ken Silverman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Silverman), [American McGee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_McGee) and [Ken Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Williams_(game_developer)).
However, life eventually took a different turn (I was still a passionate gamer, but never went beyond that) and I ended up moving into the humanities field for a long time: literature, movies, art, but most importantly music. I taught myself how to play the guitar and write for different instruments, whilst helping myself with softwares, and even joined a band (recording, playing gigs, you know it...), which turned out to be a beautiful experience. I still have a [Soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/antonioriccelli) online, though it's been inactive for a long time.

In June 2015, aged 24, one week after graduating from university, I took a flight to the UK and never looked back. With no prior job experience, I started working as Barista at Costa Coffee, and gradually progressed to better roles. Whilst working as a Supply Chain Analyst, I taught myself how to use Excel and started writing some complex formulas to automate reports and dashboards, and realised I really enjoyed it. Looked further into it and fell in love with programming.

So far, I've been mostly self-taught in everything I've done.
